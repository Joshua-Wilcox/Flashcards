I want to add new features to the flashcard submission process.

I want to change how the Topic, Subtopic and Tags feature works. I now want it to be a text box that shows a list of suggestions underneath. For example, If I choose algorithmics as my module and then start typing in the topic - it will then show me the most common topics in algorithmics, if I start typing, it will then sort by the most similar topics to what is already written in the dropdown and also sort by how many times it occurs in questions - some kind of recommendation algorithm. Critically ensure that the suggested topics are from the same module as was previously chosen - this will mean that you must force the user in filling the form in the following order: module -> topic -> subtopic -> tags.  At the top of this drop down there should be a "+ create topic" button which will allow the user to add their custom topic without having to click the suggestions below in the dropdown, highlight this "+create topic". Say I choose "Graph Algorithms" as my Topic, the subtopic box will now allow me to write and will do a similar process, suggesting me the most common subtopics that are in both the module and the topic in the database, and then it will dynamically adjust suggestions based on my typing and will also have the "+create subtopic" button in the same way at the top. 

Tags are different as there needs to be multiple of them, so allow the user to write a tag one at a time with an "add tag" pill. Require at least 3 tags. When clicking the "add tag" pill, it will also suggest tags in a similar way to how the topic and subtopic suggestions worked but will also allow for custom tags.
